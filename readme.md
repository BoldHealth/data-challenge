# Bold Health Data Challenge

## The Prompt

The goal of this challenge is to understand how you deal with complex and unclean data to address relevant business/product questions. 

Under the `data` directory, you will find the following datasets:

- `users.csv` contains an anonymized subset of our real users table with certain profile data for each user.
- `module_log.csv` contains an anonymized subset of real users progress through our program modules. As you may know by now, our IBS app Zemedy guides users through a clinically-validated program which consists of modules broken down in several sessions (e.g. module 1 session 2). 

We want to understand how well our users progress through the program, after all our success depends on having all users complete it! We want to know which segment comply better than others and what ideas you might have as to why this is. 

## Deliverables

Using the programming language (or statistical package) of your choice (Python preferred), we expect you to do and show work in the following:

- load and clean data
- perform some exploratory analysis
- identify drivers of program compliance
- generate possible hypotheses of what might explain these phenomena

The final deliverable could be a simple markdown/doc file or presentation. This is entirely up to you.
